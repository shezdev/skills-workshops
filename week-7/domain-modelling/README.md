#Domain modelling and disseminating knowledge

Domain modelling is a great way to get an overview of your application, and also to share that overview with others. It can help us to predict future problems and reveal current architecture constraints that may unknowingly be halting our progress. It is also a great skill to be able to understand and discuss other people's architecture and code. The learning objectives for this workshop are as follows:

* Construct and explain a domain model
* Understand and criticise a previously unknown domain model
* Compare elements of different domain models

## Instructions
* As a group, draw up a diagram model of your weekly project (10 minutes)
* Consider the names of your objects, their responsibilities, and the flow of data between them
* Present your domain model to your cohort, allowing time for questions (Maximum 5 minute presentation, followed by 5 minutes of questions)
* Watch the other presentations and take them as an opportunity to learn from each other - find out why they made different design decisions, and also help them with any constructive criticism you may have (remember your XP values!)
