#Domain modelling and disseminating knowledge (1hr 20mins)

This workshop is best presented on Wednesday of a project week such as Further JS week, when students are working in separate groups, each with a similar brief.

##Learning Objectives
* Describe a domain model as a conceptual model of behaviour and state
* Apply your knowledge of domain models to draw a diagram of your application
* Evaluate and criticize domain diagrams

##Starter (5 minutes)
* Introduce the learning objectives and ask people how confident they feel about them on a scale of thumbs
* Collaborate with students to draw a simple domain model such as Boris Bikes
* Talk about a relevant experience of using domain modelling to solve a problem
* Introduce the task - to create and present a domain model that describes the current state of their application
* Remind students to use XP values when giving and receiving feedback

##Plenary (5 minutes)

*Identify some common themes in the models.*
- What issues have you solved by domain modelling?
- What makes a good domain model?

*Common issues that domain modelling can help with*
- spotting an object with many dependencies
- gaining visibility on an object with too many responsibilities
- highlighting objects with poorly defined responsibilities
- simplifying an interface
- iterating rapidly on a design
- communicating ideas to others
