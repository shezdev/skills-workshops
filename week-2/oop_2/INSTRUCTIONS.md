# OOP 2: Concretes and Abstracts (1 hour)

## Learning Objectives:

- Differentiate between 'abstract' and 'concrete'
- Explain what is meant by the advice 'Separate out the things that change from those that stay the same'
- Give some differences between adding features to systems with poor OOP and good OOP

## Starter (10 minutes)

Ask students: "what are the **abstractions** behind the following sets of **concrete** things?"

- 1, 15, 8, -2 _(Number)_
- Red, Green, Blue, Puce _(Colour)_
- XML, HTML, JSON, TXT _(Data type, or interchange format)_

Explain:

- In programming, we want to move from systems that handle many specific cases to systems that handle a general case â€” from concrete things to abstractions
- We should aim to separate the treatment of concrete things from the treatment of abstract things

## Main (40 minutes)

Instructions are in [the README](README.md). Students implement the same set of features in both poor OOP and good OOP environments.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

Discuss: What was easier about working with the well-separated system? What was harder?

Common themes:

- It was easier to 'follow the pattern' (**idiom**) that was there in the 'good' example
- It was quicker to implement the feature in the 'terrible' example because it was all in one file
- It is easy to see how more complicated features could make the 'terrible' example very messy.
