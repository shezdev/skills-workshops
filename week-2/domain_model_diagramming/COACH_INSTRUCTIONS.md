# Domain model diagramming

## Learning objectives

See [README](./README.md).

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Do thumbs on the learning objectives.

* Ask the students to read the README.  (Even better to send it out before the workshop so you can potentially save time in the workshop.)

* Do a very quick Q&A.

* Do thumbs on the learning objectives.

## Main (50 minutes)

* Set the students going on implementing the coin flipping program.

* Tell the students when 25 minutes is up and set them off for another 25 minutes on the notebook user stories.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Ask some students to draw their diagrams on the board.

* Questions:
  * Ask about the amount of time students spent diagramming, vs the amount of time students spent writing code.
  * Ask about the sorts of problems the students would find in their domain model when coding.  Talk about how they could change their approach to diagramming to find these problems at the diagram stage.
  * Ask about what types of diagram were the most useful and why.

* Do thumbs on the learning objectives.
